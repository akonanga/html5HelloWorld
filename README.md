#This is submitted out of protest
1.  I was enrolled in this course since November 2014.
1.  I was monitoring the status of my projects (5 & 6) because out of all the items those are the only "not checked" status for me.
1.  The week of March 2, I noticed that Project Intro Project: HTML5 Hello World was not checked.
1.  So I sent an issue via the "Report an Issue" function and up to now no reply.

##Hopefully, evaluating this project would not take 2 weeks.

I intend to finish this by the end of March 2015 so that I would not incur further charges on my part.
The payment for this course is coming from my own personal finances.
Though I can reimbursement this but ONLY when my company approves it.
